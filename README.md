# Frustrating Tic-Tac-Toe 

Frustrating Tic-tac-toe is a Tic-tac-toe game, written in Python and played in the terminal.
Players have the choice to play it, either in Multi-player against each other, or in Single-player, against the 
frustrating computer player.  
Why is it so frustrating?  
Because as a player, you cannot possibly win against the computer, the best chances you have is to get a draw.


## Requirements
Python3

## Starting the game on *nix
Very simple, just type: 
```sh

```

## How to play

When prompted please enter '1' or '2' to play either Single-player or local Multi-player respectively.
